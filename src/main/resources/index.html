		<p>This is a proof of concept to illustrate the relevance of trust
			among users in a Social graph. This application employs the use case
			of a Question and Answer application as a test bed for our algorithms
			to show how web of trust can help us in reaching a possible answer to
			questions based on user responses both within and outside a person's
			network.</p>
		<p>The application can also be used to see different
			pre-configured scenarios on how our algorithm can handle the cases of
			malicious user(s).</p>
